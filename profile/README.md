## About The Web3 Security Labs

The Web3 Security Lab is a decentralized security collaboration network for the global Web3 ecosystem. It is dedicated to providing efficient, verifiable, and transparently trustworthy security audits through a hybrid audit model that combines AI analysis with global security researchers.

By integrating AI-based preliminary reviews, expert-level secondary reviews, and open community collaboration, we make the audit process faster, more accurate, more cost-effective, and open to wider participation from top-tier security researchers worldwide.

The goals of the Web3 Security Lab include:

Enhancing audit efficiency with AI: Using intelligent auditing as the first line of defense to proactively detect common vulnerabilities and structural risks.

Connecting top security researchers globally: Attracting diverse and highly skilled auditors through an open audit mechanism.

Strengthening the overall security of the Web3 ecosystem: Enabling more projects to receive professional, secure, and verifiable protection.

Building a transparent and open audit ecosystem: Ensuring clear workflows, fair rewards, and fully traceable audit results.

The Web3 Security Lab is not just an audit platform — it is an experimental ground for shaping the future of the Web3 security industry. By introducing new collaboration models, new productivity tools, and new participation mechanisms, we aim to make protocol security more reliable, benefiting developers, auditors, and users alike.
